# fox flux

This is a slightly NSFW puzzle-platformer where you turn into things.

It requires [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10.2 and nothing else.

Thank you [glip](http://glitchedpuppet.com/) for providing the [soundtrack](https://floraverse.bandcamp.com/album/fox-flux-demo-ost), title screen art, and [universe](http://floraverse.com/)!


## Running

Just install LÖVE and run this repository with it.
